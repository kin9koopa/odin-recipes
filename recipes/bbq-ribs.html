						The best, most fool-proof way to make sure that your ribs are fall
						off the bone tender is to bake them, covered, at a low temperature
						in your oven. We bake our ribs in a 275° F oven for two to three
						hours. It is this simple method that guarantees tender ribs!

						<h2>PREPARE RIBS</h2>
						<li>1. Heat oven to 275° Fahrenheit (135C).</li>
						<li>
							2. If the ribs still have the thin membrane covering the back of
							the rack, remove it. See how in the notes section below.
						</li>
						<li>
							3. Season both sides of the ribs with a generous amount of salt
							and pepper. If you are using a spice rub, add season the ribs with
							it now. Place the ribs, meat-side up, into a large roasting pan or
							rimmed baking sheet. (It may be necessary to cut the ribs in half
							for them to fit into the pan).
						</li>
						<li>
							Cover the pan or baking sheet tightly with aluminum foil, and then
							bake until the meat falls easily from the bones, 2 ½ to 3 ½ hours.
							We like to check the ribs after 2 hours to see how they are
							progressing. The ribs are done when the meat is cooked through and
							tender.
						</li>
						<h2>MAKE BARBECUE SAUCE</h2>
						<li>
							1. While the ribs bake, make the barbecue sauce. Heat the olive
							oil in a saucepan over medium heat.
						</li>
						<li>
							2. Add the onions and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 8
							minutes. Stir in the cumin and cook for an additional 30 seconds.
						</li>
						<li>
							3. Add the ketchup, hot chili sauce, brown sugar, and apple cider
							vinegar. Stir to combine, season with salt then cook for 2
							minutes. Set aside in preparation for the ribs to finish roasting.
						</li>
						<h2>To Finish</h2>
						<li>
							1. Remove the ribs from the oven, discard the aluminum foil and
							generously brush both sides with barbecue sauce.
						</li>
						<li>
							2.Optional: Move an oven rack near the top of the oven. Turn
							broiler to high and broil the ribs for 3-4 minutes, just until the
							barbecue sauce begins to caramelize. (Keep a close eye on the ribs
							while they broil so the sauce does not burn.)
						</li>
